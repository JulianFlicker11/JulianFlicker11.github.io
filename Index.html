  <h1>My name is Julian</h1>
  <p>
    I am currently playing Red Dead Redemption 2, just started it, and it's fun!<br>
    I find it cool that the depth of knowledge is put into the internet, and classes like this one help me discover the secrets written by the tech wizards of the past.<br>
    Another cool thing going on with me is that I'm working on making a Minecraft server on an old PC I'm buying!
